# Bus-Mall
**BusMall is a catalog of assorted products meant to be placed on local busses providing a mental escape while commuting through traffic.**  
**In this step of the project, we are doing a market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interestâ€¦ before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion. This app displays potential products to individuals in focus groups (three products at a time, side-by-side-by-side) to let the viewer chooses which product, of the three displayed images, that he would be most likely to purchase, and then store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.**
